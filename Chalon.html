            <h3>BATTLE OF CHALON</h3>

    
<P>WHERE:<P/>
<P>In Gaul France</P>
<p>WHEN:</p>
<P>451 A.D</P>   
<P>WHAT: </P>
<P>The battle of Chalon (also called The Battle of the Catalaunian Plains (or Fields), Battle of the Campus Mauriacus, Battle of Troyes or the Battle of Maurica) where Attila fought the Romans for half the western Roman empire.</P>
<P>HOW</P>
<P>Attila solution to the dry summers causing drought and starvation for his people was to raid and attack towns and cities. His most famous was the ‘Battle of chalon’, which if won would see him with half the western Roman empire and food and water for his people. Attila needed an excuse to attack Rome which came about when Attila was sent an Engagement ring from the current Roman Emperors sister Honoria, who was trying to escape an arranged marriage. Attila had requested half of the western roman empire as a dowry but was refused along with the engagement which the emperor declared was a mistake. This was Attilas chance to attack the Romans. </P>

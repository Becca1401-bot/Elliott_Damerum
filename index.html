            <h3>ATTILA THE HUN</h3>

          <brk><h2>Issue: Severe drought and starvation for people of the Hunic empire</h2>

<p>WHY:</p>
<p>Due to the Huns location, they would have been victims of the extreme dry climate between 420 A.D – 450 A.D meaning they would have to alternate between fixed farming and herding their animals along to greener pastures.  Attilas army would attack towns and cities for resources for his people, then by 451 A.D he had the opportunity to not only save his people but also expand his empire. </p>
</brk>
<p>WHO:</p>
<p>Atttila the Hun, nicknamed “Flagellum Dei” Meaning ‘The scourge of God” </p>
<p>Leader of the Huns in the 5th Century </p>
<p>Birth of Attila: 406CE in Pannonia a province of the Roman Empire in Transdanubia (present day Hungary) where he grew up.</p>
<p>Died: 453CE of a brain hemorrhage </p>
<p>The Huns were described as Barbarians by the Romans which meant someone who is not a citizen of Rome and doesn’t speak Latin. In modern terms “barbarians’ means someone who is uncivilized, crude and violent. </p>
<p>Attila was a feared warrior as he had never lost a battle until the ‘Battle of Chalon’ where he ended up retreating, giving the Romans an undecisive win but a win, nonetheless.  </p>         <brk></brk>
